# Game-Engine

A light weight game engine currently under developement.Its a hobby project of mine.Theres lots to reorganize and cleanup.Currently it uses GLFW for input handling, window creation and management and openGL context creation.It uses Assimp for model loading and stb_image for texture loading.
